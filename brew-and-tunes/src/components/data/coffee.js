With a coffee this fruity and intensely flavored, we take a lighter approach to the roasting profile to let the beans shine on their own. From producer Abdullah Bagersh, the ripe, drying coffee cherries are turned on raised beds for 48 hours to ensure an incredibly consistent, high-quality product.',
